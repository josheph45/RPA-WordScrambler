# RPA-WordScrambler

[Demo](https://youtu.be/3OuIAbEDlC0)

A UiPath Studio Robotic Process Automation (RPA) that transforms a standard text editor into an interactive gaming environment. This project demonstrates web scraping, string manipulation, and real-time user input validation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Word Sourcing**: Scrapes 5-letter words directly from a live web source using Chrome.
- **Notepad Integration**: Uses Microsoft Notepad as the primary interface for game display and user input.
- **Difficulty Tiers**: User-selectable time limits that dictate the pressure for the guessing phase.
- **Real-time Validation**: Logic-based verification to check user guesses against the original unscrambled string.
